       "# Data Overview\n",
       "The dataset in this project was collected during a series of speed dating events.  It contains participant demographics, answers to survey questions regarding their interests, their lifestyles, how they rate themselves and others on a number of different attributes, and many other interesting fields.  It also contains a column on participant decisions about whether they liked each of their dating partners (yes / no), as well as whether two dating partners matched (both decided 'yes'). The Data Dictionary below describes the contents of each of the many available fields.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Insights\n",
       "What insights can we gleam from this data?  There are many interesting fields, from people's interests, their ratings of themselves and their partners, the stated vs. the actual value they place on attributes, a number of demographics, etc.  The notebook [speed_dating_insights.ipynb](https://github.com/datascienceinc/dating_insights/blob/master/speed_dating_insights.ipynb) contains a few interesting analyses to get you started.  What other interetsting questions can you answer from this data?\n",
       "\n",
       "### Model\n",
       "Can you predict if two people are a good match?  Your goal is to build a classifier to predict whether two participants matched (`match` field) using features in sections 1 and 2 in the Data Dictionary below.  Be careful, as sections 3 and later may contain fields with **target leakage** that should not be used!  You may also wish to use the existing features to engineer new features, such as age difference, an interest similarity index, etc.\n",
